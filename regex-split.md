# Regex Tutorial: split sentences

Regular expressions are patterns used to match character combinations in strings. In JavaScript, regular expressions are also objects. These patterns are used with the exec() and test() methods of RegExp, and with the match(), matchAll(), replace(), replaceAll(), search(), and split() methods of String.

## Summary

In this tutorial, I will cover the split() methods of String using the following example:

let paragraph = 'Hello! How are you doing? This is Kevin. Kevin is my son.';
let sentences = paragraph.split(/[!,?,.]/);
console.log(sentences)
